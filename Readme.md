# Advent of Code 2020
Sharing my solutions for Advent of Code 2020, this one describes the method/libraries I've used.

## 15th Dec
- List and dict
  
## 14th Dec
- Binaries are okay, but memory-terms (address, bits, masks etc) are confusing!

## 13th Dec
- Found a simple solution, after trying heaps of slow loops

## 12th Dec
- Simple structures, however manual approach

## 11th Dec
- Back to numpy arrays again to manipulate structure

## 10th Dec
- Tricky one - tried generating all solutions, but was too slow.
- Tried again with recursive functions, also too slow
- Added caching and it was quick

## 9th Dec
- Simple lists/enumerate

## 8th Dec
- Functions!
- 
## 7th Dec
- Recursive functions
- 
## 6th Dec
- Sets, lists and loops
- 
## 5th Dec
- Simple lists/dicts/loops

## 4th Dec
- More Regex

## 3st Dec

## 2st Dec
- Regex it is

## 1st Dec
